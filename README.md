# Text Editor

The application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the Progressive Web Apps (PWA). It will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, I will be using the following tools:-

- **Webpack** - Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

- **PWA** - A <ins>Progressive Web Application</ins>, commonly known as a progressive web app, is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly

- **Lighthouse** - Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

- **IndexedDB** - The Indexed Database API is a JavaScript application programming interface provided by web browsers for managing a NoSQL database of JSON objects. It is a standard maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium. As an alternative to the Web storage standard, IndexedDB can provide more storage capacity
